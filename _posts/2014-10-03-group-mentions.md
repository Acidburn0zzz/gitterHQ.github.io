You've always been able to individually @mention your teammates in Gitter chat rooms, but today we're rolling out a new feature where you'll be able to @mention everyone in the room using `@/all`.

<!--more-->

In order to keep the noise down, in **repo rooms** we're only allowing contributors to use `@/all`. 
In **org** rooms, any user can use `@/all` to get the attention of their entire team.

In addition to `/all`, in future, we'll also be adding support for GitHub team mentions, so 
you'll be able to mention a specific team, like `@/qa` or `@/devops`.

As always, please let us know in [gitterHQ/gitter](https://gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter),
on Twitter [@gitchat](https://twitter.com/gitchat) or via [support](http://support.gitter.im) 
if you have any comments.

Happy chatting!
