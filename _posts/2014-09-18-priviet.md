Russian language rooms form our largest non-English communities and we have started embarking on translating our app into Russian.
<!--more-->

We've started on the front page and will gradually start moving all of the strings in the application over to externalised templates.

It is very possible that some of the translations are a bit wrong. We used an agency to help us with this and it's possible they didn't quite understand a few things.

You can help contribute to this via our [translations repo on GitHub](https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter-translations).
