When most people see this cat, they think *awwww cute*.

But some people think this:

Imagine how frustrated they must be not being able to easily express themselves in chat rooms around the world. Well... **now you can use LaTeX on [Gitter](https://gitter.im)** by using the brilliant [KaTeX library](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8320439) from the Khan Acadamy. The above expression would be represented as follows:

```
$$\left(\int{-\infty}^\infty x^2 |f(x)|^2\,dx\right)\left(\int{-\infty}^\infty \xi^2 |\hat{f}(\xi)|^2\,d\xi\right)\ge \frac{|f|_2^4}{16\pi^2}.$$
```

Bonus points: The first person to tell us what that equation represents will get a 100% free discount code for any of our paid plans.

Bonus bonus points: When that cat gif gets too much, you can now collapse it in any of your Gitter chat rooms. Just look for this icon, click it and breathe a deep sigh of relief.

You're very welcome.

##What is Gitter?

Gitter is where developers come to talk. We host thousands of public communities where developers from all around the world come together to talk about the future of programming, build better products, and share the best cat GIFs.

You can also use Gitter for private conversations for free, or with any of our paid plans.
