The amazing thing about our journey building Gitter is just how global our communities are. We're a fairly international team ourselves, comprised of two South Africans, an Englishman, a Brazilian and an Argentinian. I'm sure there's a joke there somewhere.

Japanese language rooms form our second largest non-English communities and we have started embarking on translating our app into Japanese.

We've started on the front page and will gradually start moving all of the strings in the application over to externalised templates.

It is very possible that some of the translations are a bit wrong. We used an agency to help us with this and it's possible they didn't quite understand a few things.

You can help contribute to this via our [translations repo on GitHub](https://github.com/gitterHQ/gitter-translations).
